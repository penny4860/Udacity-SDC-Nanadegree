I am going on the SDC nanodegree. This repository is a collection of projects.

## Computer Vision and Deep Learning  - Term 1

1. [Finding Lane Lines on the Road](1_lane_lines/)
	* Lane detection algorithm using opencv
2. [Traffic Sign Classifier](2_cnn_cls/)
	* Image classification using convolutional neural networks
3. [Behavioral Cloning](3_clone/)
	* Clone driving behavior using deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks.
4. [Advanced Lane Finding](4_lane_detect/)
	* Pipeline to identify the lane boundaries in a video from a front-facing camera on a car.
5. [Vehicle Detection and Tracking](5_vehicle_detect/)
	* Pipeline to identify vehicles in a video from a front-facing camera on a car. 
	
## Sensor Fusion, Localization, and Controll - Term 2

6. [Extended Kalman Filters](6_ekf/)
	* Extented Kalman filter to estimate the state of a moving object of interest with noisy lidar and radar measurements.
7. [Unscented Kalman Filters](7_ukf/)
	* Unscented Kalman Filter to estimate the state of a moving object of interest with noisy lidar and radar measurements.
8. [Kidnapped Vehicle](8_particle/)
